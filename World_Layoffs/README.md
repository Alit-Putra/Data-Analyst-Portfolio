## Layoffs Data Cleaning Project

This project is part of Alex The Analyst - Data Analyst BootCamp which focuses on cleaning and preparing a dataset of company layoffs for analysis. The raw data includes records of layoffs across various industries, locations, and stages.

### Dataset
- **Source**: [Layoffs Dataset](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/MySQL-YouTube-Series/blob/main/layoffs.csv)
- **Raw Data**: Contains inconsistencies, null values, and duplicate rows.

### Objective
To clean and standardize the data for further analysis by:
- Removing duplicates
- Standardizing fields (e.g., dates, industries)
- Filling or handling missing values
- Adding a primary key for easy identification

### Tools Used
- **MySQL** for querying and cleaning
- **MySQL Workbench** for MySQL IDE
- **GitHub** for version control

### How to Reproduce
1. Create schema with name `world_layoffs`.
2. Load the raw dataset (`layoffs.csv`) into the schema.
3. Run the SQL queries in (`layoffs_cleaning.sql`).
4. Review the cleaned dataset (`layoffs_cleaned.csv`).
